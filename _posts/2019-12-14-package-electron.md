We need the install a packager. Create a directory called 'build' in the root directory of the application we have just been working on. Stay in that directory where the package.json file is.

```
npm install electron-builder --save-dev
```

We need to edit the package.json file. If you have VSCode installed just type 
```
code .
```

select the package.json for edit.
