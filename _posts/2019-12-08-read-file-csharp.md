# Reading a file in C# is so easy.
I have an rss feed that I want to read and process. Opening an reading this file in C# is a one line command.

Well 3 lines if you want it to be any use.

{% highlight csharp %}
    string fileLocation = @"D:\export.rss";
    string textFromFile = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(fileLocation);
    Console.WriteLine("Contents of {0} = {1}", fileLocation, textFromFile);
{% endhighlight %}
